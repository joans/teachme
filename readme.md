# Skillpact

Skillpact is a web app that connects people who have a certain skill with people who search for that same skill. It functions as a marketplace where one can offer their skill and another can search for skills. Anyone can be a teacher of their skill on Skillpact. Skill sharing is done on a voluntary basis with no costs involved for neither teacher nor student. Skillpact helps to match and connect, skill lessons are then organized between teacher and student themselves - online or offline.

## Motivation

We believe that anyone is brilliant in something and has an intrinsic motivation to share their expertise with others. Your signature dish is the yummiest bowl you have ever eaten and you want to teach someone else to prepare it themselves? Skillpact offers you the possibility to share your skill with others. You have always wanted to learn that one chord on the guitar which just won't sound right? Visit Skillpact to find a teacher who is an expert at that exact chord, connect with that person and have a great time learning and teaching together.

Skillpact is currently being developed as a group project in the frame of the Web Development track of TechLabs Hamburg's Digital Shaper program. For more information on the program, visit [TechLabs HH](https://techlabs.org/location/hamburg).
